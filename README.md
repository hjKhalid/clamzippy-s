# Navbar with Responsive Design and Breadcrumb on Mobile

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive navigation bar with smooth scrolling functionality. The navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes and includes a mobile-specific breadcrumb feature. When a user clicks on a navigation link, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section. On mobile devices, a "Back to [section]" breadcrumb button appears, allowing the user to easily navigate back to the last viewed section.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The navbar is fully responsive and adapts to both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on any navigation item will smoothly scroll to the respective section of the page.
- **Breadcrumb Button on Mobile**: On mobile devices, a breadcrumb button appears, allowing users to go back to the previously viewed section.
- **Interactive Effects**: Navigation items change color and display a shadow on hover, enhancing the user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the project:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to Use

1. **Desktop View**:
   - The navbar will be displayed horizontally with links to different sections (e.g., Introduction, Causes, Effects, Solutions, etc.).
   - Clicking on any link will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.

2. **Mobile View**:
   - On smaller screens, the navbar will transform into a collapsible menu.
   - The "hamburger" icon (three bars) will toggle the menu visibility.
   - A breadcrumb button will appear when a section is clicked, allowing users to go back to the last viewed section.

## Code Structure

- **Navbar Component**: Contains the main logic for rendering the navbar and handling the scroll-to-section functionality.
  - **scrollToSection(id)**: A function to scroll to the element with the specified `id`.
  - **goBack()**: A function to scroll back to the previous section (used for the breadcrumb button).
  - **isMenuOpen**: A state variable to manage the visibility of the mobile menu.
  - **breadcrumb**: A state variable to store the name of the last viewed section (for mobile breadcrumb).

- **Responsive Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with responsive classes like `lg:hidden`, `lg:flex`, and `mt-4` to adjust the layout based on the screen size.

## Dependencies

- **React**: The framework used for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For the mobile menu toggle icon (hamburger and close icons).

## Screenshots

### Desktop View:
